Project that builds a virtual book store


Functionality so far. 
-> We are able to login based on the in-memory users 
-> We can view fictions or nonfictions books available in database

Next things to do. 
-> Define Roles of users and a way to register new user. 




Some ISSUES needs to be fixed. 
1:  The same html file is used twice for fictions and nonfictions books rendering. It can be improved somehow to using one file for displaying
    books based on the request path.
